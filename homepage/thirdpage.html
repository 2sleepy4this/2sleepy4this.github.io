            <h class>A Gem In The Rough</h>
            <p>It used to be located at 295 Grand Street, New York and now it has moved to Mott Street. At first glance, Shu Jiao Fu Zhou doesn't seem inviting because of the smelly streets, dirty glass windows, and the graffiti on the wall; compared to Itaewon that attracts tourists from all over the world because of pretty street lights and party vibes. When you walk inside, you’ll see three condiments on each table, soy sauce, hot sauce, and vinegar. The floor creaks a bit when you walk on it and the tables are all placed to the side leaving one walkway toward the cashier. When you’re here, you’ll sometimes hear the cashier yell orders to the people in the kitchen. Their voices sound like they're mad or annoyed but rest assured it's just how we talk.
            </p>
            <p>The food here is unique. The meat within Shu Jiao's hand-wrapped dumplings is juicy and oozing with flavor. The skin of the dumplings is thin and chewy. Anyone is likely to enjoy the classic combo of ground pork and chives. The flavor of the dumpling is completed by adding a small amount of their exclusive semi-sweet chili soy sauce. In Fu Zhou cuisine, the combination of a sweet and sour flavor is typical. Famous components of Fu Zhou cuisine include soups, fishballs, and "bian rou." Unlike traditional fish balls, the handcrafted fish paste ball contains a flavorful pork stuffing. The inclusion of pork inside the already delicious plain fish balls generates a taste of explosion in your mouth.
            </p>
            <p>The first time I went I remember thinking the restaurant wasn't very well decorated and the seats were taped to cover the stuffing that was about to fall out. It lacked aesthetics. I was having doubts about eating at this place and that the food being served wouldn’t be good. I went up to the cashier and shyly said “one plate of peanut butter noodles and soup,” in Fuzhounese. After ordering my food and eating it, it was the best thing I have ever tried. It was worth eating there even though the restaurant wasn’t that well organized. After eating there more, I grew more and more comfortable coming here.
            </p>
            <p>Then I realized this place reminds me of home. The owners of this restaurant are a family of Fuzhounese immigrants. My parents are also Fuzhounese immigrants who came to America and opened a restaurant to make a living. It was on the first floor of our home, so I saw it everyday. But our restaurant is no longer open so eating at Shu Jian Fu Zhou brought back memories and gave me the feeling of nostalgia. Both our restaurants definitely weren’t the best decorated but different people still come to eat the food we make. We made lo mian, shrimp broccoli, wan tan, etc. The kitchen was right behind the cashier, which was my mom, and she would yell behind her the orders, just like the cashier at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou. Shu Jiao Fu Zhou also allowed me to dive deeper into part of my identity as a Fuzhounese. I was born here in America and eating one of the most famous dishes, “peanut butter with wheat noodles,” allowed me to taste my cultural food.
            </p>
            <p>Shu Jiao Fu Zhou is a place that allows other Chinese immigrants who share similar stories to be able to empathize with them. They build a sense of community in Chinatown for all the Chinese immigrants living there. It is a place where they can gather if they miss their homeland. Just like Koreatown is a place filled with Korean culture, it builds a community for Korean people and Korean immigrants. Or like Little Italy, where it's a place people can gather to eat Italian cuisine and for Italian immigrants to hang out. New York is a place filled with different cultures that people can build a home on.
            </p>
            <p>When I go to Shu Jiao Fu Zhou I see people that are white, hispanish, african american, etc., not only Chinese. It's a place appreciated by different people and they are joyus to ask other customers what they would recommend. The language barrier that people worry about when they order food is not something to be worried about here. The cashier here is able to speak the common language, English. The same thing can be said about Nam Son. It's a place that makes their specialty pho noodles. Here they share Vietnamese cuisine. I like to come here to eat pho noodles with savory pork chop and from the times I’ve spent here, I’ve seen people from different backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Everyone here, in New York, are always up and ready to try new foods and not just stick with the foods they grew up with. Everyone feels comfortable opening up a restaurant that they specialize in making and not be afraid of the judgment they may receive from others. That's what helps even more in building a community of different cultures in one place.
